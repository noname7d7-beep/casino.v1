Money Talks — project (iSignal)

Structure:
- index.html (main)
- style.css, script.js, lang.js
- /assets/games/ -> add your game images here (aviator.png, mines.png, plinko.png, chickenroad.png, footballx.png, thimbles.png)
- /assets/sounds/ -> replace placeholder with house-loop.mp3 (if you want background music)
- /games/ -> individual game pages (placeholders)

How to use:
1) Download the archive and extract.
2) Replace images in assets/games/ with your own images (names: aviator.png, mines.png, plinko.png, chickenroad.png, footballx.png, thimbles.png)
3) (Optional) Put an MP3 file into assets/sounds/ named 'house-loop.mp3' to enable background music.
4) Upload to GitHub (place files in repo root) and deploy on Vercel (select project root).

Notes:
- The audio included is a placeholder text file. Replace it with an actual MP3 file.
- Background canvas and animations are pure JS/CSS and lightweight.
